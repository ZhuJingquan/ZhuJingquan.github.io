## scp

SYNOPSIS

     scp [-12346BCpqrv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
         [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program]
         [[user@]host1:]file1 ... [[user@]host2:]file2
DESCRIPTION

     scp copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh(1) for data
     transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same security
     as ssh(1).  Unlike rcp(1), scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if
     they are needed for authentication.
    
     File names may contain a user and host specification to indicate that the
     file is to be copied to/from that host.  Local file names can be made
     explicit using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid scp treating file
     names containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.  Copies between two remote hosts
     are also permitted.
